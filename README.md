This repository consolidates my best coursework, project deliverables, and personal study notes from earning a First Class Honours in Computer Science at UCD. It highlights my specialisation in AI/ML, including lecture summaries, coding assignments, project write-ups and demos — all organised for reuse, review and refinement as I progress in my Data/AI engineering journey.
