    "In this we will look at using superised machine learning algorithms to predict music genres. Specficially, the objective here is to classify the genre of a song from Spotify, based on a range of associated audio features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each song in our dataset is described by a range of features:\n",
    "- artist_name: Song artist \n",
    "- track_name: Song track name\n",
    "- acousticness: Describes the likelihood that the song is purely acoustic\n",
    "- danceability: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity\n",
    "- energy: A perceptual measure of intensity and activity. More energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy\n",
    "- instrumentalness: Indicates whether a song includes vocals or not\n",
    "- liveness: Describes the likelihood that the song was recorded with a live audience.\n",
    "- loudness: Overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB), averaged across the entire track\n",
    "- speechiness:  Describes the likelihood that the song contains spoken words\n",
    "- tempo: Estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM)\n",
    "- valence: Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, angry)\n",
    "- genre: Target label ('Pop' or 'Rock' in this case)\n",
