/*
 * Task-4: Club
 * The doorman Bruno at the popular night club Heaven is having a hard time
 * fulfilling his duties. He was told by the owner that when the club is full,
 * the number of women and men let into the club should be roughly the same.
 * When the night club opens, people wanting to enter the club are already
 * lined up in a queue, and Bruno can only let them in one-by-one. He lets
 * them in more-or-less in the order they are lined up. He can however decide
 * to let the second person in the queue cut the line and slip into the club
 * before the person in front. This will no doubt upset the person first in
 * line, especially when this happens multiple times, but Bruno is quite a
 * big guy and is capable of handling troublemakers.
 *
 * Unfortunately though, he is not that strong on mental calculations under
 * these circumstances. He finds keeping track of the difference of the number
 * of women and number of men let into the club a challenging task. As soon
 * as the absolute difference gets too big, he loses track of his counting
 * and must declare to the party people remaining in the queue that the club
 * is full.
 *
 * Input: A string containing a positive integer (describing the largest
 * absolute difference between the number of women and number of men let
 * into the club that Bruno can handle) followed by a comma and then a
 * string consisting solely of the characters ’W’ and ’M’ of length at
 * most 100, describing the genders of the people in the queue, in order
 * of their arrival. The first character of this string is the gender
 * of the person first in line. You may assume that the club is large
 * enough to hold all the people in the queue.
 *
 * Output: The maximum number of people Bruno can let into the club
 * without losing track of his counting.
