1. According to the lecture, what is the primary purpose of authentication in a system?
	a. To verify the identity of a user or process attempting to access protected resources.
	b. To track the history of passwords used by a user.
	c. To grant users permission to access specific resources.
	d. To encrypt data transmitted between a user and a server.

2. The lecture outlines different factors used for authentication. Which of the following is an example of "something you have" as an authentication factor?
	a. A mobile phone used for receiving a one-time password.
	b. A username or User ID.
	c. A Turing test.
	d. A password or PIN.

3. What is the key distinction between authentication and authorization as described in the lecture?
	a. Authorization occurs before authentication in the process of accessing a resource.
	b. Authentication verifies identity, while authorization grants permission to access resources after identity validation.
	c. There is no significant distinction between authentication and authorization; they are interchangeable terms.
	d. Authentication verifies access rights, while authorization validates identity.

4. According to the lecture, what was the initial primary use of passwords when they were first introduced in 1961?
	a. To secure critical infrastructure systems.
	b. To secure e-commerce transactions.
	c. To protect email accounts.
	d. To restrict access to specific files and allotted time slots on a mainframe system.

5. The lecture highlights the risks associated with password reuse. What was a statistic mentioned regarding password reuse after the Sony breach?
	a. 59% of people were still using the exact same password on Yahoo! Voices a year later.
	b. 93% of people started using stronger passwords.
	c. Only 1% of users reused passwords across different platforms.
	d. Password reuse decreased by 75% due to increased awareness.

6. According to the lecture, what is the primary benefit of using cryptographic hash functions for storing passwords?
	a. They allow for easy reversal back to the original password if needed.
	b. They prevent any possibility of password cracking.
	c. They hide the password by generating a unique, fixed-size output (digest) from the input password.
	d. They encrypt the password, making it unreadable.

7. The lecture discusses password salting. What is the main advantage of using salt when hashing passwords?
	a. It makes the resulting hash shorter and easier to store.
	b. It prevents attackers from using pre-computed hash tables (like rainbow tables) effectively, as the same password will have different hashes due to the unique salt.
	c. It eliminates the need for strong password policies.
	d. It speeds up the password hashing process.

8. The lecture touches on human behavior related to passwords. Which of the following is a common tendency mentioned?
	a. Using the same password across multiple accounts.
	b. Creating passwords with a high percentage of non-alphanumeric characters.
	c. Utilizing password managers to store unique, strong passwords for each service.
	d. Regularly updating passwords with complex combinations.

9. Which of the following password attack methods involves using a predefined list of words and common variations to try and guess passwords?
	a. Brute force attack.
	b. Reverse Lookup tables attack.
	c. Dictionary attack.
	d. Social Engineering/Phishing.

10. According to the lecture, which of the following is a popular password cracking tool?
	a. Kismet.
	b. Nmap.
	c. John the Ripper (JTR).
	d. Wireshark.
