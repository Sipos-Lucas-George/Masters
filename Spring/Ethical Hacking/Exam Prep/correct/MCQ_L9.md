1. The potential for unauthorized access to business resources and unsegmented systems like point-of-sale terminals and printers.
2. Cryptographic weaknesses in the RC4 cipher used by WEP, allowing for passive or aggressive packet capture and key recovery.
3. To obtain cryptographic values that can be used to verify the hash of a guessed passphrase offline.
4. The pre-generated hash table is specific to the Service Set Identifier (SSID) of the target network.
5. The use of an eight-digit PIN that could be efficiently guessed due to a design flaw revealing if the first half was correct.
6. To trick users into connecting to the attacker's network, allowing for the capture of hashed credentials for offline brute-force attacks.
7. To identify and remove records of previously connected open or untrusted networks that devices might automatically reconnect to.
8. The captured network traffic after the renegotiation interval cannot be decrypted using the initial four-way handshake.
9. Wash.
10. Users are accustomed to connecting to open networks in these locations and may not suspect the malicious nature of the access point.
