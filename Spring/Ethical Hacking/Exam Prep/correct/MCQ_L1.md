3.	560 million
4.	$1 million USD
5.	Hacktivism
6.	There is currently no fix available for the exploited vulnerability.
7.	Many attackers operate discreetly and go unnoticed by security devices and staff.
8.	Their systems may soon be under attack.
9.	Software tools that carry out specific procedures to achieve a desired result.
10.	Ethical hackers always operate with the explicit permission of the target.
11.	Penetration tester
12.	To emulate the techniques of real attackers without causing damage, enabling organisations to better protect themselves.
13.	To probe ports and services on a range of IP addresses using automated scanning products and identify potential vulnerabilities.
14.	Although they indicate the severity of a vulnerability, they rarely indicate its impact.
15.	They have either gained root privileges on a critical system or control of the domain administrator account.
16.	Obtaining formal approval and a written agreement (Statement of Work) outlining the scope and legal requirements.
17.	Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
18.	Using scanning tools to probe the target’s public exposure, including network mapping and banner grabbing.
19.	The operating system type and patch level, applications and their patch levels, open ports, running services, and user accounts.
20.	Some tools may not work, some may cause services or servers to fail, and some may be successful.
21.	To escalate the security context, such as gaining root or administrative rights.
22.	Recording everything that was found, how it was found, the tools used, exploited vulnerabilities, and the timeline of activities.
23.	Ethical hackers are constrained by legal and ethical boundaries, while unethical hackers have no such limitations on their targets.
24.	To make it more difficult to trace the attack back to the attacker’s own system.
25.	Ethical hackers will focus on documenting their findings, while unethical hackers will often try to preserve access for future use by installing backdoors or rootkits.
26.	Scrubbing event and audit logs, hiding uploaded files, and disabling messages to security software.
27.	To fix open vulnerabilities so that other attackers cannot use the system for their own purposes.
28.	Ethical hackers meticulously document their process and findings, while unethical hackers typically do not document their activities.
29.	It enables organizations to proactively tailor their defenses against both current and anticipated threats and trends.
30.	Activities focused on the intellectual challenge of exploitation to those primarily aimed at generating revenue.
31.	Personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and financial details.
32.	Political ideologies and the desire to influence social change.
33.	There is no existing patch or fix available for the exploited vulnerability at the time of the attack.
34.	Attackers often employ stealthy techniques to remain below the detection threshold of both automated systems and human observation.
35.	Proactively identify potential imminent attacks and implement preventative measures.
36.	Intended purpose and the actor’s motivation when using them.
37.	To emulate the techniques of real attackers without causing harm, thereby enabling the organization to improve its defenses.
38.	A vulnerability assessment identifies potential weaknesses, whereas a penetration test goes further by attempting to exploit those weaknesses to determine their actual impact.
39.	Achieving either root-level privileges on critical Unix/Linux systems or control over the domain administrator account.
40.	Establishing a formalized written agreement, often a Statement of Work (SOW), that defines the scope, objectives, and legal requirements of the test.
41.	Collecting publicly available information about the target without direct engagement.
42.	Active Scanning and Enumeration.
43.	Conduct a thorough probe to identify specific details about the target systems, such as operating system versions, installed applications, and open ports.
44.	Operates without any pre-defined limitations or “hands-off” targets and without the target’s security team being aware.
45.	To obscure their origin and make it more difficult to trace the attack back to them.
46.	Installing rootkits, backdoors, or trojaned applications to ensure the ability to regain access later.
47.	Erase evidence of their activities by modifying logs, hiding files, and disabling security software alerts.
48.	Prevent other attackers from exploiting the same vulnerabilities and potentially taking control of the system.
