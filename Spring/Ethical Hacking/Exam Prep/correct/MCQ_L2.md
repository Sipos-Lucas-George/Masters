1.	Firewalls, HTTPS, and other security controls alone.
2.	An ongoing investment in a “defense in depth” strategy, akin to having an immune system.
3.	Perform penetration testing, incident investigation, and reporting of security vulnerabilities.
4.	Poor coding practices during software development.
5.	Grows exponentially as you progress through the SDLC, being significantly more expensive in post-production.
6.	“Black Hats” and security researchers often at the forefront of discovering new exploits and methodologies.
7.	Creating freely-available articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in web application security.
8.	A testing framework based on engineering and scientific principles, offering a consistent and repeatable approach to web application testing.
9.	Function as a web and mobile application security training platform to improve penetration testing skills.
10.	A popular free and actively maintained security tool for automatically finding vulnerabilities in web applications and for manual testing.
11.	Specializing in information security and cybersecurity training, covering areas like penetration testing and incident response.
12.	Ranking the top 25 most critical security vulnerabilities based on their exploitability and impact.
13.	An American not-for-profit organization that manages Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs).
14.	A community-developed list of common software security weaknesses, acting as a common language and a baseline for mitigation efforts.
15.	A publicly known information security vulnerability or exposure that has been identified.
16.	Assign severity scores to vulnerabilities, aiding in the prioritization of responses and resource allocation.
17.	Where the vulnerability exploitation is possible, with the score increasing as the attack can be launched from more remote locations.
18.	The exploit depends on specific conditions that may be beyond the attacker’s control.
19.	The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific authorization to exploit the vulnerability.
20.	The vulnerability’s exploitation can impact resources beyond the initial scope or privileges of the exploited component.
21.	All information within the impacted resource is divulged, or highly sensitive information is leaked, causing serious impact.
22.	High severity.
23.	Believing that perimeter defenses like firewalls and protocols like HTTPS inherently guarantee immunity from breaches.
24.	Establishing multiple overlapping security controls across different layers to increase resilience against attacks.
25.	Performing penetration testing, incident investigation, and reporting of security vulnerabilities.
26.	Practical experience in the field alongside strong collaboration and communication abilities.
27.	Predominantly poor coding practices and a lack of prioritization of security during software development.
28.	30 times more expensive.
29.	A game of cat and mouse where attackers try to evade detection by defenders.
30.	It is less about simply learning techniques and more about cultivating a mindset of looking at things differently and understanding potential weaknesses.
31.	Ransomware attacks, with broken access control causing the most harm.
32.	Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
33.	OWASP Mobile Security Project.
34.	A consistent, repeatable, and defined approach to security testing based on engineering and scientific principles.
35.	There are an infinite number of ways an attacker might be able to compromise an application, meaning testing cannot guarantee complete security.
36.	Serve as a web and mobile application security training platform to improve penetration testing skills.
37.	An integrated platform for performing comprehensive security testing of web applications.
38.	Information security and cybersecurity training, including areas like penetration testing and incident response.
39.	Common coding errors that lead to security vulnerabilities.
40.	Managing Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and running initiatives like CWE and CVE.
41.	Assign severity scores to computer system security vulnerabilities to help prioritize responses.
42.	The exploit depends on specific conditions that are often beyond the attacker’s direct control to manipulate.
