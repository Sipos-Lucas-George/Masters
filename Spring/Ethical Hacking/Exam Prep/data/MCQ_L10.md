1. According to the lecture, what is the primary purpose of authentication in a system? 

a. To grant users permission to access specific resources. 
b. To verify the identity of a user or process attempting to access protected resources. 
c. To track the history of passwords used by a user. 
d. To encrypt data transmitted between a user and a server.
2. The lecture outlines different factors used for authentication. Which of the following is an example of "something you have" as an authentication factor? 

a. A password or PIN. 
b. A mobile phone used for receiving a one-time password. 
c. A Turing test. 
d. A username or User ID.
3. What is the key distinction between authentication and authorization as described in the lecture? 

a. Authentication verifies access rights, while authorization validates identity. 
b. Authentication verifies identity, while authorization grants permission to access resources after identity validation. 
c. Authorization occurs before authentication in the process of accessing a resource. 
d. There is no significant distinction between authentication and authorization; they are interchangeable terms.
4. According to the lecture, what was the initial primary use of passwords when they were first introduced in 1961? 

a. To secure e-commerce transactions. 
b. To protect email accounts. 
c. To restrict access to specific files and allotted time slots on a mainframe system. 
d. To secure critical infrastructure systems.
5. The lecture highlights the risks associated with password reuse. What was a statistic mentioned regarding password reuse after the Sony breach? 

a. 93% of people started using stronger passwords. 
b. 59% of people were still using the exact same password on Yahoo! Voices a year later. 
c. Only 1% of users reused passwords across different platforms. 
d. Password reuse decreased by 75% due to increased awareness.
6. According to the lecture, what is the primary benefit of using cryptographic hash functions for storing passwords? 

a. They encrypt the password, making it unreadable. 
b. They hide the password by generating a unique, fixed-size output (digest) from the input password. 
c. They allow for easy reversal back to the original password if needed. 
d. They prevent any possibility of password cracking.
7. The lecture discusses password salting. What is the main advantage of using salt when hashing passwords? 

a. It speeds up the password hashing process. 
b. It makes the resulting hash shorter and easier to store. 
c. It prevents attackers from using pre-computed hash tables (like rainbow tables) effectively, as the same password will have different hashes due to the unique salt. 
d. It eliminates the need for strong password policies.
8. The lecture touches on human behavior related to passwords. Which of the following is a common tendency mentioned? 

a. Regularly updating passwords with complex combinations. 
b. Using the same password across multiple accounts. 
c. Utilizing password managers to store unique, strong passwords for each service. 
d. Creating passwords with a high percentage of non-alphanumeric characters.
9. Which of the following password attack methods involves using a predefined list of words and common variations to try and guess passwords? 

a. Brute force attack. 
b. Reverse Lookup tables attack. 
c. Dictionary attack. 
d. Social Engineering/Phishing.
10. According to the lecture, which of the following is a popular password cracking tool? 

a. Wireshark. 
b. Kismet. 
c. John the Ripper (JTR). 
d. Nmap.
